### 🌿 Diagnosis: {disease.replace('___', ' ').replace('_', ' ')}
* **Cause**: {rec['cause']}
* **Primary Treatment**: {rec['treatment']}

#### 🛡️ Organic Remedy
- Spray Neem Oil (5ml/L of water) mixed with mild soap.
- Prune and safely burn infected foliage to prevent spores spreading.
- Apply Trichoderma viride bio-fungicide to soil.

#### 🧪 Chemical Control
- Apply Copper Oxychloride (2.5g/L) or Mancozeb fungicide.
- Spray in early morning or late afternoon to avoid leaf burn.

#### ⚠️ Progression Insights
- **Days 1-5**: Spores expand, creating concentric rings or lesions.
- **Days 6-10**: Leaves yellow, dry out, and drop. Photosynthesis decreases, causing yield loss.
- **Days 11+**: Spreads to stems and fruit, potentially destroying the crop.
